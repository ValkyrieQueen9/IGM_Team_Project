    /* Script Plan
       * This section might get very long and confusing when all the clue information is added.
       * Because we might be using two pieces of clue information (with and without the sword/ink), the itemInfo string in the interactable script might not work so well anymore.
       * I'm wondering whether we should make a new script like ClueSelector which can check the players inventory and trigger all the clue pop ups and trigger the games win?
       * We can also add the story writing straight into the script which could make bigger chunks of writing easier to look through.
       * 
       * It could look like this in this script:
       *      if (distance <= interactable.radius)
       *      {
       *          ClueSelector.ClueFound(interactable.name);
       *      }
       *      
       * This would use a new script and method and could look like this:
       *      private void ClueFound(string clueName)
       *      {
       *          if (clueName == "Stone") //Checks which clue it is
       *          {
       *              if(playerInventory.inventoryList.Contains("Sword")) //check if player has sword
       *              {
       *                  //show clue with options? - without options can just be a bigClue, strings used for itemInfo can be created in this new script?
       *                  
       *                  string stoneClueCompleteInfo = "A stone"; //Add all the writing here for each clue rather than in the inspector?
       *                  string stoneClueAnswer1 = "Put the sword in the slot";
       *                  string stoneClueAnswer2 = "do nothing";
       *                  clueInfo.ClueQuestionPopUp(stoneClueCompleteInfo, stoneClueAnswer1, stoneClueAnswer2);
       *              }
       *              else
       *              {
       *                  //show clue telling the player to search more
       *              }
       *          }
       *      }
       * 
       * For the CluePopUps I will create a new gameobject to use and a new method in ClueInfo that has more parameters for the information.
       * I'm not sure this will make much sense but I have the idea in my head and will probably forget it in the morning so I thought it best to write it down!
